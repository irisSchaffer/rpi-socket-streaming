# rpi-socket-streaming
Code for my *[Taking photos with raspberry pi + socket.io]( http://irisschaffer.com/taking-photos-with-raspberry-pi-socket-io/)* tutorial.

This code makes it possible to stream photos taken on a raspberry pi in regular intervals to a remote server, using nodejs, socket-io and data-uris.
For more information about this repository and implementation details, please refer to the aforementioned [tutorial]( http://irisschaffer.com/taking-photos-with-raspberry-pi-socket-io/) and feel free to raise issues, or contact me via e-mail.
